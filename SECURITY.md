# 🔒 Security Distribution Strategy

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Source Code Protection

The source code is **NOT** included in this public repository for security reasons. Only the following files are shared:

### 📁 Public Files (Safe to Share)

- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `webpack.config.js` - Build configuration (obfuscation settings)
- `README.md` - Public documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - GitHub setup guide

### 🔐 Private Files (NEVER Share)

- `src/` folder - Original source code
- `background.js, content.js, popup.js` - Root source files
- `README_PRIVATE.md` - Implementation details
- `BUILD.md` - Detailed build instructions
- `dist/` folder - Built extension (generated locally)

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

1. **Source Code Hidden**: Original code is not pushed to GitHub
2. **Always Obfuscated**: All builds use obfuscation (even dev builds)
3. **No Source Maps**: Source maps are disabled for security
4. **Build-Only Distribution**: Users must build their own copy
5. **Credential Protection**: No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

## 🚀 Distribution Process

### For Public Release:

1. **Build locally**: `npm run build`
2. **Test thoroughly**: Verify extension works
3. **Create release package**: Zip the `dist` folder
4. **Upload to GitHub Releases**: Provide pre-built ZIP for users

### For Developers:

1. Clone repository (only gets build files)
2. Run `npm install` to get dependencies
3. **Source code must be obtained separately** (private repo/direct sharing)
4. Build with `npm run build`

MISSING (Private):
├── 📁 src/                    # 🔐 Private source code
├── 📄 README_PRIVATE.md       # 🔐 Implementation details
└── 📄 BUILD.md                # 🔐 Detailed build guide
```

## ⚡ Quick Setup for End Users

1. **Download release** from GitHub Releases
2. **Extract ZIP file**
3. **Load in Chrome** extensions page
4. **No building required** - ready to use!

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ **Source code protected** from reverse engineering
- ✅ **Easy distribution** via GitHub releases
- ✅ **Still open source** (build process is transparent)
- ✅ **Security through obscurity** combined with obfuscation
- ✅ **Professional approach** for sensitive extensions

---

_🔒 This security model ensures that while the extension remains usable and the build process is transparent, the actual implementation details and logic remain protected._
